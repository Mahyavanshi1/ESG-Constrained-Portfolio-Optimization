# ESG-Constrained-Portfolio-Optimization-LSE
This project optimizes a portfolio of FTSE 100 stocks using CAPM returns and Ledoit-Wolf covariance. It evaluates three scenarios: no ESG constraints, mild ESG (≥0.6), and aggressive ESG (≥0.8). Metrics like expected returns, volatility, and Sharpe ratio are compared. Visualizations include heatmaps, bar charts, and historical price trends.
